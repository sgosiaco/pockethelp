## Inspiration
To build an app the combines the Chegg, Course hero and possibly wolfram api into one useful app for students that also has some tools like class time management and GPA calculator.
## What it does
Currently it functionally doesn't do anything due to my lack of experience with REST api calls in java, but the framework for the UI and activities are there.
## How I built it
I used android studio
## Challenges I ran into
REST api calls in java and the lack of time
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Actually making something that doesn't crash
## What I learned
Developing an android app that is aesthetically useful with good animations is difficult. I should've used fragments for my activities instead of the default type.
## What's next for Pocket Help
To hopefully implement the REST api calls and redo the user interface with fragments.
